# Bhujhanjatha.com – AI-Powered Website for a Small Business 🚀

Hey there! 👋

I recently ran a little experiment, and it turned out to be **super cool**. I helped my friend get their small business online **without writing a single line of code**! Yes, you read that right – 0 lines of code. 🎉

## What I Did

- Used **AI prompts** to design and generate the entire website.  
- Total prompts needed: **20** (yep, it really was that few!).  
- Total time: **under 4 hours** from start to finish.  
- Hosted the website on **Netlify** and connected it to a purchased domain: [bhujhangjatha.com](https://bhujhangjatha.com).  
- The result: a **sleek, professional-looking website** perfect for a small business wanting an online presence.

## Tools & Tech

- **Bolt** – The only tool I used to create the website. (It’s basically magic ✨)  
- **Netlify** – For hosting and going live in a few hours.

## Why This Experiment Was Game-Changing

1. AI can **create usable websites super fast** – no coding skills required.  
2. Small businesses can **go online in hours** instead of days or weeks.  
3. Debugging still needed **some basic knowledge**, but nothing too heavy.  
4. It was **fun** to see AI turn prompts into a fully functional website.

## Key Takeaways

- AI is a powerful co-creator – it’s not a replacement for knowledge but an **amplifier**.  
- Even with minimal experience, you can **bring ideas to life quickly**.  
- 20 prompts + 4 hours = a live, beautiful website 🌐
